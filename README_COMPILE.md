# How to compile the Universal Node

## Automatic set up

It is possible to set up the Universal Node (UN) in two ways:

  * by compiling each component by hand; this allows to have the complete control on the UN set up.
    If you are interested in this way of setting up the UN, please continue to read this document;
  * using an `ansible` script that automatically compiles and installs all the components required
    by the UN. This method allows less customization with respect to the manual set up. If you are
    interested in this way of setting up the UN, please refer to [./utils/README_SET_UP.md](./utils/README_SET_UP.md).

## Required libraries

Several libraries are required to compile the Universal Node.
In the following we list the steps required on an **Ubuntu 14.04**.

	; Install required libraries
	; - build-essential: it includes GCC, basic libraries, etc
	; - cmake: to create cross-platform makefiles
	; - cmake-curses-gui: nice 'gui' to edit cmake files
	; - libboost-all-dev: nice c++ library with tons of useful functions
	; - libmicrohttpd-dev: embedded micro http server
	; - libxml2-dev: nice library to parse and create xml
	; - ethtool: utilities to set some parameters on the NICs (e.g., disable TCP offloading)
	
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui libboost-all-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libxml2-dev ethtool
	
	; Install JSON Spirit (nice library to parse JSON files)
	; Alternatively, a copy of JSON Spirit is provided in `[un-orchestrator]/contrib/json-spirit.zip`
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/sirikata/json-spirit
	$ cd json-spirit/

	; Now install the above library according to the description provided
	; in the cloned folder
	
	; Update the dynamic libraries cache
	$ sudo ldconfig


## Getting the code

The UN source code can be downloaded in two ways, depending on whether
you would like to be in sync with the UN main GIT repository or just 
download the sources, without being synchronized with the repository.

In the first case it would be easy to get new updates from the repository
and possibly commit your changes back in the main branch; in the second
case you will have to syncronize the code manually.

Getting the code through GIT:

	; Clone the main GIT repository
	$ git clone https://github.com/netgroup-polito/un-orchestrator.git
	
	; Your code is now in the `un-orchestrator` folder.

Simply downloading source code:

	; Download source code in the `master` branch
	$ wget https://github.com/netgroup-polito/un-orchestrator/archive/master.zip
	
	; Your code is now in the `un-orchestrator-master` folder.

In order to compile and setup the different components of the Universal Node,
you have to follow the instruction provided in each subfolder.
